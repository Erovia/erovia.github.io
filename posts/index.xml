      <description>Why? Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, testing new features, bug fixes, etc is time consuming.
But you can help.
While it&amp;rsquo;s true that ultimately the Collaborators decide on things, any feedback is greatly appreciated and can help the whole project move forward.
Knowing how to test PRs also allows you to use the stuff in them even before they get merged.
How? It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite easy, but assuming you are familiar with git and how its branching works at the basic level.</description>
